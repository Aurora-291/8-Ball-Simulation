## Struggles & what i have learned:
### What I Struggled With:

* All the css layers were a total pain getting the aurora behind the stars behind the content was a nightmare of z-index.
* Performance was a big one. At first all the animations made my computer fan go crazy so i had to figure out how to make them more efficient.
* Saving all the different settings to localstorage got messy i kept forgetting to save one of the toggles or the volume.
* The shake animation on the ball was tricky to make it look natural and not just like it was twitching.
  
### What I have learned:

* You can do some insane stuff with just css animations and gradients.
* The Web Audio API.
* Planning to save the data is important before you start writing the code.
